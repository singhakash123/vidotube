// fields should be an array of objects with name and optionally a maxCount. Example:

// destination is used to determine within which folder the uploaded files should be stored. This can also be given as a string (e.g. '/tmp/uploads'). If no destination is given, the operating systemâ€™s default directory for temporary files is used.
